# cs-math-evaluator
A simple c# function capable of evaluating a mathematical operation which is given in the form of a string, such as "(5+6)x(3/9)".
The EvalMath function takes one argument in the form of a string and returns the result as a float.
The string should be sanitised before being passed into the function as it will result in an error otherwise.
